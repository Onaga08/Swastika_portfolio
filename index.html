                            As a dedicated oral and maxillofacial surgeon, my primary goal is to provide patients with the highest standard of care, delivered with a focus on comfort and pain-free treatment. I firmly believe that successful treatment is not just about the technical skill required, but also about fostering a relationship built on trust, communication, and genuine care. I take the time to understand each patient's unique needs, ensuring they feel heard, respected, and supported throughout their entire treatment journey.

                        Over the years, I have had the privilege of performing a wide range of complex procedures, honing my skills in various aspects of oral and maxillofacial surgery.

I am also well-versed in orthognathic surgery, helping patients achieve improved functionality and aesthetics through corrective jaw procedures. My practice includes a variety of minor oral surgeries, as well as surgical interventions that are an integral part of orthodontic treatment plans.
